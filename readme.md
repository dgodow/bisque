# Bisque

A Chrome extension that helps writers get things done by managing their time, measuring their productivity, and avoiding distractions.

- Track your output (words per minute) on various sites
- Graph your productivity over time to find hours, weeks, or months when you aren't getting as much done
- Customize your "greylist", which identifies distracting sites and graphs your biggest sources of distractions
- Schedule work and break periods to maximize focus with notifications to let you know when it's time to switch

# Instructions

```
git clone https://github.com/dgodow/go-outside
npm install
npm start

Check out your Chrome extensions and ensure that Go Outside is enabled. Click on the app icon to trigger a cycle of tab creation and removal (an artificially accelerated version of "break" vs. "work" time).
```
